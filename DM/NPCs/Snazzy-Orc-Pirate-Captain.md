# Snazzy, the Orc Pirate Captain

Lvl 9 Retired Mercenary Orc - Turned Glorified Ferry Captain - Goodish/Scoundrel

## Overview

Snazzy was a mercenary in pointless wars until finding himself in Wintersail. A quick weekend turned into a long rest turned into him saying yes when the Resort Owner asked him to play a dramatic pirate captain while ferrying new arrivals into the cove. 

- Playful, joking, rarely serious
- Loyal to the Resort Owner
- Excellent Captain and Sailor
