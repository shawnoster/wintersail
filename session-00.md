His grin only broadens as the first, but not nearly the last, of his esteemed guests succumbs to the Fey Flip, over the side please.

> Crawling to the rail you barely make out a sandy cove, a loose collection of stalls, shops, humble two and three story homes, large resorts, and secluded villas nestled amid green, dense jungle. It isn't until you adjust to the light, and the booze still sloshing in your stomach, that you notice both the village and forest is backed by a massive, gleaming, almost pure glacier, humbly towering above all.

## Welcome

 You've decided to become an adventurer! Congratulations! You've left your previous life behind to pursue... something. Fame, social justice, mushrooms, decadent delights, to prove a point, to try out an accent, to do fucking SOMETHING.

 Welcome to Wintersail, a boozy introduction to the mechanics of D&D, both to the players and the DM. At this point you know a few things, and Snazzy, our Orc Pirate Captain, fills you in on a few others. 
 
 You, as a beginning quester, has taken up a very generous offer of helping out a Costal Resort Village with a small problem, that you've reassured everyone you're qualified for, in exchange for a free week at the resort and some good adventurer gear. While the details were vague you were reassured it's in your wheelhouse. Here's what you slowly learn to your terror...

- A dragon turtle, and 20 something of her most loyal and fieriest followers, have been a guest at the largest resort in Wintersail for a week
- The dragon turtle has grown fond of the warm waters and has decided to stay for another week
- This conflicts with a long standing reservation by the Order of Tides clerics, who meet here every 100 years, for A Reason.
- The Rumor is that the The Reason is Something Evil Being Released Into the World, that causes destruction. No one at the bars Snazzy goes to knows much more than that, though everyone has their own favorite reasons.

You are there to be asked very nicely by the resort owner to please ask an ancient (ooops, I shoulda charged for that) dragon turtle to leave the only waters that are keeping her calm enough to not table flip the coastal shelf in order to make room for something a bunch of nervous clerics are fairly insistent must happen in order for the continued safety of the world (and their positive Y'rp reviews in the Book of Guilds, The GiveAFuck Edition, Highly Rated By _The Fucking Pissed Off Dragon Gnome. Figure That Out Yourself, the One and Grandest._ It really was a fuck-all title)

## Cool Story Ya, But So, Now Ya?

- Think of who is waking up hungover with 20-something=level energy levels, so fully pumped for what's ahead. Young, old, scarred, innocent, pure stereotype, defining archetype, drunk fuck-e-teer (like a puppeteer, ken?), what made you stop your before and what made you agree to help bounce a stubborn guest?
- Dive into the books, reach into your imagination, get whacky, go full random, etc. All things on the table, I am story and person driven, using math to direct.
- Send me your tiki-village bouncer character from D&D, invite me to your bar, or come to my house, and let's roll your character. Help me build this.

## House Rules

- If a spell lists a component; verbal, material, whatever the fuck else, I want it incorporated into your description of your action. Assume infinite stock, I don't sweat the inventory but I'm here for the drama bitches, I want to fucking SEE your glitter when you describe your epic mother-fucking throw-downs.

## Best

What's best in life? Not having to have everything fucking figured out. ✌️
